This was the first book I ever read by Malcolm Gladwell. And I am a fan now. This book is a literal example of thinking outside the box. Every part of this book is extremely well explained and it will challenge the reader to actively take part in reflecting and illustrating the points told by the author. 

Throughout this book author makes readers question their analytical skill when it comes to interacting with a stranger. This book helps to understand how stereotyping is blocking proper evaluation of a situation or a person. It is not always based on race/cast/creed/sex, rather it’s the old mindset that is fed to us by our history. This book is very well backed up by data. It you follow it will show some interesting data to explore your brains at.

I personally recommend this book highly. It is so refreshing to explore this type of possible explanations of such subjects, that I have already thought about so many times. But I never thought about it this way.

Final Thoughts : This book does not tell you how to actually talk to strangers. Author did not specify on what is the proper way to analyze a situation or person. But after reading the book I think it is quite right to not provide so, since the book’s core essence is to not conform with conventions.
