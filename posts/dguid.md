             Anyone who have read books by bibhutibhusan, will notice he really focuses on describing nature and it's true beauty. I don’t have enough knowledge to critique this author. But I have been a fan of his works.

 I read the book when I was really young. Like 8 or 9. It moved me how a simple village boy, from typical, not so well off family ends up searching for his destiny in Africa. The book is so well versed on detailed natural beauty, like every other book he has ever written. It’s like I am wearing VR glasses and I can so clearly that it feels like Shankar is showing my way through the tall, dry grass of Africa.
