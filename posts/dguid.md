   Anyone who have read books by Bibhutibhusan, will notice he really focuses on describing nature and it's true beauty. I don’t have enough knowledge to critique this author. But I have been a fan of his works.
   I read this particular book when I was really young. Like 8 or 9. It moved me how a simple village boy, from typical, not so well off family ends up searching for his destiny in Africa. The book is so well versed on detailed natural beauty, like every other book he has ever written. It’s like I am wearing VR glasses and I can see so clearly that it feels like I myself is present there on the sidelines.

What's even more interesting is author never went to Africa. In fact he never traveled outside India. He saw pictures of Africa read about volcanoes.He was so skilled at depicting picture into words in such a way that readers can feel it.This is such a good experience for young readers,because they mostly look for adventure and are generally keen to pick up knowledge.And this book is just perfect for that.I have read this book many times and will do again.It never gets old.

Final Thoughts : Book focuses on adventure and readers experience.I loved it personally.It enhances readers experience on Bengali literature. This book is worth reading at least once in your lifetime.
